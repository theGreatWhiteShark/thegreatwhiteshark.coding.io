<p>It was in mid autumn when I heard there will be a local version of the
Chaos Computer Congress, the annual conference of the German hacker
association <a href="https://www.ccc.de/en/">Chaos Computer Club</a>, called
<a href="https://datenspuren.de/">Datenspuren</a> in the city of Dresden. Since I
was living in Dresden back then, my attendance was somewhat
mandatory. But when I check the program one day in advance I saw
something even better: There would be a <a href="http://www.dresden.de/de/wirtschaft/wirtschaftsstandort/projekte-kooperationen/open-data-crunch.php">hackathon organized
by the city of
Dresden</a>
and they would award prices worth of 7000€ in total. Even better: The
topic was about handling data!</p>

<p>So I quit work early that Friday and headed over to the office of
<a href="https://github.com/jusjusjus">ol&rsquo; Justus</a>, who was in
immediately. The goal of the hackathon was as follows.</p>

<p>The city of Dresden has a number of infrastructural, election, and
general statistical data. But they do not really know how to use
it. Sure, they do have a web page where you can have a look at the
data. But this is it. Back then there was no API to access the raw
data or whatsoever. Some people in the city council might have
thought: <em>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we hand a big portion of the data to the nerds
and look what they would do with it.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In its essence the data provided by the city was the underlying files
of the so-called <a href="http://stadtplan2.dresden.de/">Themenstadtplan</a>, the
interactive map of the city of Dresden to display information. Since
they were made available beforehand, Justus and me took a deep dive
into it to come up with a catchy idea. And we did.</p>

<h1 id="which-part-of-town-fits-me-best">Which part of town fits me best?</h1>

<p>This is a question asked especially by young students, who are about
to start their studies at the local university. You have never been to
the city but yet you have to search for a place to live at.</p>

<p>In our project we want to condense most of the data of the city into 3-5
plausible
variables, which can be used to describe the overall lifestyle and
atmosphere in a district and are independent of each other. The choice
of the user should be displayed as a heatmap on Openstreetmap tiles
showing Dresden and she should be able to alter her choice of the
variables interactively using some sliders. Since I had some
experience in creating such interactive widgets from writing my
<a href="https://github.com/theGreatWhiteShark/climex">climex</a> app, we were
convinced to pull it off in just one day. Unfortunately this is all the
time you have at a hackathon.</p>

<p>Next day around 15:00 we started the project. Fortunately Stephan, a
very talented college, joined too and he brought another person
capable of programming some JavaScript. Some hours later, at 00:45, we
had two working versions of the application! A JavaScript-based
Leaflet application and a R-based fallback solution written by me. It
consumed a lot of strength but it was one of the most adventurous
weekends I had in Dresden.</p>

<p>We decided to let the user specify five different input variables.</p>

<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Ländlich vs. städtisch&rdquo; (rural vs. urban) - which is calculated
using the density of the population</li>
<li>&ldquo;Monochrom vs. bunt&rdquo; (monochrome vs. colorful) - whether there are
lots of persons of color in the district or not</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nationalbewusst vs. alternativ&rdquo; (patriotic vs. alternative) -
calculated via election results</li>
<li>&ldquo;Familie vs. Selbstverwirklichung&rdquo; (family vs. self-fulfillment) -
this variable is computed from the weighted densities of different
sites like playgrounds, pubs, fitness studios etc. in the region
(calculated via a point in polygon method using the borders of the
districts and Openstreetmap data)</li>
<li>&ldquo;ÖPNV Verfügbarkeit&rdquo; (access to the public transportation) - number
of bus and tram stops in a district</li>
</ol>

<p>The first three variables are dimensions for which the user has the
choice to incorporate them or not. Variable 4 and 5 will always be
present and weight the resulting density obtained by the first three.</p>

<p>In case you are wondering about variable 2 and 3: Dresden, the capital
of the state of Sachsen, is so damn right-winged and conservative it
actually hurts. No one should have to live next to a fascist!</p>

<h1 id="result">Result</h1>

<p>In the end we won one of the main prices and the price for the best
visualization! Only team with to awards FTW!</p>

<p>You can find the awesome talk of Stephan presenting the project on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znWmLYXqkpQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>By now you must be pretty excited about trying the
application. Fortunately
there is Github Pages to host static web pages. So <a href="https://thegreatwhiteshark.github.io/StadtteilsucheDD/index.html">try it</a>.</p>
