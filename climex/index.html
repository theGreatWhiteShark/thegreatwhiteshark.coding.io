<p>The <strong>Climex</strong> app is my longest and most comprehensive endeavor in
the realm of programming and software development up to now. It
started as a couple of wrapper functions in the beginning of my PhD in
2015 and is still (at the time of writing) under active development.</p>

<p>In this post I won&rsquo;t explain the motivation and basics of the extreme
value analysis (EVA), which can be found in the vignettes of the
package, but its basic handling and the improvements it introduces.</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>There are already a bunch of <strong>R</strong> packages for the fitting of extreme
value distributions. So, why did I decided to write my own one?</p>

<p>Right from the start I wanted to perform EVA on a massive parallel
scale by fitting the generalized extreme value (GEV) and generalized
Pareto (GP) distribution to all stations within a country or region or
to all grid points of a climate model/reanalysis data. But when apply
the EVA to several hundreds of time series in parallel, I always
encountered errors or numerical artifacts for at least a couple of
them. Exchanging the fitting functions and packages helped for
specific stations. But then again all packages produced errors; just
for different stations. So I decided to dive into this topic and to
write a package, which is more robust, fits my needs and permits a
massive parallel application.</p>

<h2 id="improved-fitting-routines">Improved fitting routines</h2>

<p>The parameter estimation for the stationary GEV and GP distribution
using the maximum likelihood method in an unconstrained optimization
(done by all other <strong>R</strong> packages involving extreme value statistics)
tends to produce numerical artifacts. This is due to the presence of
logarithms in the negative log-likelihood functions and a limited
range of shape values the maximum likelihood estimators are defined
in. While yielding absurdly large parameter values or causing the
optimization to fail when using the <strong>BFGS</strong> algorithm (in the
<em>extRemes</em> package), the differences using the <strong>Nelder-Mead</strong>
algorithm (all other packages, e.g. <em>ismev</em>) might be small, barely
noticeable, and totally plausible. But they are still present and
spoil your calculation.</p>

<p>In order to avoid those numerical artifacts, the <strong>augmented
Lagrangian method</strong> is used to incorporate both the logarithms and the
limited range of shape values as non-linear constraints. With this
approach the optimization can be started at arbitrary initial
parameter combinations and will almost always converge to the global
optimum. Only for initial parameter combinations chosen very badly the
algorithm can still produce artifacts. But an improved version of the
already quite decent heuristics for choosing them will prevent it.</p>

<p>This solves two remaining problems of the extreme value analysis:</p>

<ol>
<li>The user does not have to worry about the numerical optimization
anymore. It will produce the correct results in nearly all cases.</li>
<li>The optimization itself becomes more robust and can now be used in
an massive parallel setting.
<br />
<br /></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="error-estimates-of-the-return-level">Error estimates of the return level</h2>

<p>An important part of the extreme value analysis is to access the
fitting errors introduced into the calculated return levels. The
default way of obtaining them is to use the so-called delta method
assuming normality of the log-likelihood function at the fitting
result. This assumption, however, is not fulfilled in a lot of cases
and is stronger violated the higher the shape parameter of the
underlying GEV or GP distribution.</p>

<p>To nevertheless calculate a decent estimate of the fitting errors, the
<strong>climex</strong> package introduces two statistical approaches, one based on
<em>bootstrap</em> and the other one based on a <em>Monte Carlo</em> approach. In
comparison to the calculation of the confidence intervals implemented
in the <em>extRemes</em> package, the climex package calculates the standard
deviation of the return levels. Since there are a lot of different
sources of errors in the extreme value analysis, like too small block
sizes, too low thresholds, or non-stationaries and/or correlations in
the data, providing a confidence interval (CI) might the misleading
for some users. All these additional errors are by no means included
in the CI and have to be obtained in further studies to construct some
appropriate CI of the calculated return levels.</p>

<h2 id="better-error-handling">Better error handling</h2>

<p>Due to the use of either the <strong>Nelder-Mead</strong> or <strong>BFGS</strong> optimization
algorithm, some time series will throw errors when fitted using the
other <strong>R</strong> packages tailored for the extreme value analysis. When
fitting 100 stations at once you can expect at least one of them to
break your code.</p>

<p>In order to allow a massive parallel application of the extreme value
analysis, the <strong>climex</strong> package features a more robust error
handling. In addition, the improved fitting routine mentioned above
is able to handle initial parameter combinations far more distant
from the global optimum than feasible under any unconstrained routine.</p>

<h2 id="focused-on-handling-time-series">Focused on handling time series</h2>

<p>The fundamental object class handled in the <strong>climex</strong> package is the
time series class <strong>xts</strong> or lists of class xts objects. This allows
the user to harness all the additional functions tailored for the
analysis of time series, e.g. those of the <strong>lubridate</strong> package. It
also includes a couple of convenience functions often used within the
extreme value analysis, like blocking, application of a threshold,
declustering, deseasonalization etc.</p>

<p>To build a decent foundation of climatological data your analysis can
rely on, I wrote the package
<a href="https://gitlab.com/theGreatWhiteShark/dwd2r">dwd2r</a>, which downloads
large amounts of data from the FTP server of the German weather service
(DWD) and converts them into a format usable within <strong>R</strong>. For more
details see the corresponding <a href="../data-science/dwd2r">post</a>.</p>

<h1 id="shiny-based-web-application">Shiny-based web application</h1>

<p>Since it&rsquo;s quite cumbersome to handle dozens, not to mention many
hundreds of time series, I also wrote a
<a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>-based web application in the
package <a href="https://gitlab.com/theGreatWhiteShark/climexUI">climexUI</a> to
perform the EVA on the individual series.</p>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2017/climex/climex_map.jpeg" alt="leaflet-tab" /></p>

<p>It features two different tabs. The first one holds a
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">leaflet</a> map the user can
interactively choose the station she want to perform the analysis
on from. Also the most important information concerning the chosen series
is displayed in a box.</p>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2017/climex/climex_time-series.png" alt="time-series-tab" /></p>

<p>The second tab provides full control over all steps involved in the
fitting of the station data via an intuitive GUI in a persistent way
(changes will be applied to the analysis of all following time
series). You can e.g. pick either the GEV or GP distribution, exclude
single points or whole parts of a time series from the analysis, or
calculate the return level for the minimum values instead of the
maximum ones.</p>

<p>A detailed description of the different features is given in the
corresponding
<a href="https://github.com/theGreatWhiteShark/climex/blob/v1.2.0/vignettes/climex_app.Rmd">vignette</a>.</p>

<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>

<p>You are new to <strong>R</strong>? Then check out the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/#R">compiled list of
resources</a> from RStudio or
the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">official
introduction</a>.</p>

<p>A thorough introduction is provided for the <a href="res/README_data_dwd_and_usage.Rmd">general
usage</a> of the package and the
Shiny-based <a href="res/climex_app.Rmd">web application</a>, as mentioned

<p>When using this package in your own analysis, keep in mind that its
functions expect your time series to be of class
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html">xts</a> and not
numeric!</p>
