<p>To make a long story short, it&rsquo;s not trivial to access the content of
the Mensacard and I didn&rsquo;t managed to do it with the technology I had
at hand.</p>

<p>But if you ever wanted to develop code for your Arduino in Emacs
instead of the Arduino IDE, you will find a more or less comprehensive
guide to do so in here.</p>

<p>The technology I used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acer Aspire S3 running Ubuntu 16.10</li>
<li>Arduino Mega 2560</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elechouse.com/elechouse/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=90_93&amp;products_id=2242">Elechouse NFC Module V3</a> shield</li>
<li>Huawei ALE-L21</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="rfid-and-nfc">RFID and NFC</h1>

<p>But let&rsquo;s start with some basics. What exactly is RFID and NFC?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification">Radio Frequency Identification
(RFID)</a>
is a way to establish a wireless communication between an active
sender and an active or passive receiver along very short distances
(several centimeters). As far as I understood, there is no true
consensus about how this communication is established or which kind of
technology is used. In addition only small amounts of data (&lt;1kB) can
be transmitted.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication">Near Field Communication
(NFC)</a>
enters. It&rsquo;s a subset of RFID and provides a standardized protocol,
the <em>NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF)</em>, to transmit messages between
devices. This can be either used to store/access information on cards
(up to MBs) or to establish a direct communication between devices.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into detail here because in the end I unfortunately can not
apply this knowledge on a practical example. But if you are more
interested in the topic of NFC, be sure to check out the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-NFC-Communication-Arduino-PhoneGap/dp/1449372066/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483802943&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=igoe+nfc">book</a>
of Tom Igoe. I again enjoyed it quite a lot.</p>

<h1 id="android">Android</h1>

<p>So, I tweaked the app until I point I was finally able to read the
content of RFID based cards (Latest version in the
<a href="https://github.com/theGreatWhiteShark/mensacard-hack/tree/master/cordova">git</a>
repository).  But unfortunately my phone was not capable of accessing
the content of neither the Mensacard, nor the NFC tag I bought
alongside the NFC Arduino shield. I just can read the <em>Unique
Identifier Number (UID)</em> of both. You can think of this to be just the
card&rsquo;s name. It was not just my phone. In fact I tried three different
ones and each of them provided just the UID. So in the end the mobile
phones are probably just intended to use NFC for communicating with
other devices instead of interacting with cards.</p>

<p>But reading the card&rsquo;s name is already something. Imagine: You could
be spied on by people, who just read out your cards UID whenever they
pass by you or whenever you pass a certain checkpoint. Could this be
possible with an Android phone?</p>

<h2 id="detecting-nfc-cards-using-android">Detecting NFC cards using Android</h2>

<p>Yes. It&rsquo;s indeed quite easy.</p>

<p>The Android operation system handles a lot of things quite differently
than your normal computer. When you turn on your phone&rsquo;s NFC and a
corresponding card is in its vicinity, a so called <strong>event</strong> is
raised. The smartphone is more or less shouting: &ldquo;There is a NFC card
over here. Who knows how to handle it?&ldquo;. When your NFC reader is
already opened and listening, it alone will receive the information
and can process it. On the other hand, it is also possible to tell the
<em>event listener</em> to start up your app and to perform an action
whenever there is a card passing by. In this sense, someone could
write an app to collect card identities (even without accessing its
content) at certain positions and times, without running out of
battery after half an hour.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t panic. The Android phone is just able to read the <em>UID</em> up
to a distance of two centimeters through plain air. In a wallet with
other cards, even half a centimeter was enough to hide the card from
my phone&rsquo;s eyes. So people can&rsquo;t spy on you by just activating the NFC
capability of the phone in their pockets.</p>

<p>In addition the German
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_identity_card">ID</a> is encrypted
with the so called <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_Authenticated_Connection_Establishment">Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
(PACE)</a>
protocol. This one just provides a random number instead of a <em>UID</em>
and is protected by an asymmetric encryption. Only with an additional
password entered via a numpad, the card&rsquo;s UID and content can be
accessed.</p>

<h1 id="arduino">Arduino</h1>

<p>Alright. Since I was not able to access the content of the card via my
mobile phone, I will use an Arduino shield instead.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s even better than handling a micro controller to read the
Mensacard&rsquo;s information? That&rsquo;s right: doing it using
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArduinoSupport">Emacs</a> :)</p>

<h2 id="emacs-as-arduino-ide">Emacs as Arduino IDE</h2>

<p>First of all, you have to install the <em>android-mk</em> package in order to
generate a <em>Makefile</em> to transcompile the written code for the
Arduino&rsquo;s CPU.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install arduino-core arduino-mk
</code></pre>

<h3 id="transcompiling">Transcompiling?</h3>

<p>When you computer is compiling code, it translates it into a set of
CPU instructions. Those instructions represent your program and are
performed whenever you call it. But every family of CPUs has a
different instruction set and thus speaks a different language. In
order for your computer to be able to compile a piece of code in such
a way the Arduino can understand it, it has know the language of the
Arduino&rsquo;s CPU. This whole procedure of translating code into
instructions for another CPU to understand is called
<strong>transcompiling</strong> and is guided by the Makefile generated using the
<em>arduino-mk</em> package.</p>

<h3 id="enabling-serial-communication">Enabling serial communication</h3>

<p>Next, we have to add our user to the <em>dialout group</em> to be able to use
the <strong>serial communication</strong>. The later allows use to communicate with
the Arduino via USB while it is still running. This way we can both
send commands and receive messages. It would be quite pointless for
the Arduino to read a card&rsquo;s information without transmitting it to
us, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Make sure to replace USERNAME by your actual user name
sudo usermod -a -G dialout USERNAME
# You need to restart your system to apply this change
</code></pre>

<p>Do we need to be in <em>dialout</em>? Actually it would be sufficient to just
run <code>sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0</code> every time you connect your
Arduino. But this is quite nagging and you should reduce your sudo
usage as much as possible.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-arduino-development-environment">Setting up the Arduino development environment</h3>

<p>The most easy way to configure your Arduino board is to just download
Arduino&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">IDE</a> and run
it. Then choose your boards name, the processor and the port in the
<em>Tools</em> menu and you are done.</p>

<p>The IDE is storing all the preferences in your home
(<em>~/.arduino15/preferences.txt</em> in on my computer) and you can make
use of this file from within Emacs.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure if this file is actual used in the compilation
procedure. But it&rsquo;s a good starting point in case some of the settings
are messed up and your Arduino is not working smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="importing-libraries">Importing libraries</h3>

<p>In order to hook you up with to newest versions of the NFC/NDEF
libraries, I provide them as submodules. So don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t
see any content in the //arduino/libraries/PN532 folder of the git
repository yet. We still have to get their content by initializing and
updating those submodules.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Make sure you are at the root of mensacard-hack's repository tree
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
</code></pre>

<p>Now, every time you would import a library via Arduino&rsquo;s IDE, it would
just copy the folder/unzip the zip to Arduino&rsquo;s default library
path. This one is defined in the <em>preferences.txt</em> file as
<strong>sketchbook.path</strong>. I changed the default <em>~/Arduino</em> to
<em>~/software/arduino</em> to avoid having countless folders in my home. But
this is just a matter of taste. In the end you just add a line
specifying <em>ARDUINO_LIB_PATH</em> to the Makefile and you are done.</p>

<p>To install the libraries, you just have to copy all the folders from
<em>//arduino/libraries/PN532</em> into <em>sketchbook.path/libraries</em>. (All the
README.md, git related files etc. are not harmful and we don&rsquo;t have to
care about them)</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># make sure your Arduino folder really is called ~/.arduino15
cp arduino/libraries/PN532/* $(cat ~/.arduino15/preferences.txt | awk 'BEGIN {FS=&quot;=&quot;} /sketchbook.path/{print $2&quot;/libraries&quot;}')
</code></pre>

<p>The second command is just a small <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html">bash
script</a> using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a> to extract the default
directory from the preferences.txt file. Both <em>bash</em> and <em>AWK</em> are
pretty handy for especially this kind of little tasks. They are easy
to learn, since both of them are not that complex and have a fairly
limited scope of application, and enable you to harness the true power
of a Linux system. Be sure to check them out one day! (And don&rsquo;t
forget about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a> while your at
it).</p>

<h3 id="installing-arduino-mode">Installing Arduino-mode</h3>

<p>What would be writing code for an Arduino without its distinct mode?</p>

<p>Firstly, let&rsquo;s download the corresponding Lisp file. (For the sake of
completeness, I also added this file to
<em>//arduino/res/arduino-mode.el</em>).</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir --parents ~/git/emacs-spass
cd ~/git/emacs-spass
git clone git://github.com/bookest/arduino-mode.git
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have to tell Emacs where to find this file, to load it whenever
we are in need of the Arduino-mode, and which file suffixes are
associated with this mode (.ino and .pbe). I actually took a look into
the Lisp code and the package adds a hook for those suffixes
itself. But it&rsquo;s good practice to do so anyway. Therefore, we will add
the following lines to our <em>~/.emacs</em>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/git/emacs-spass/arduino-mode&quot;)
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(&quot;\\.\\(pde\\|ino\\)$&quot; . arduino-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'arduino-mode &quot;arduino-mode&quot; nil t)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting started</h3>

<p>Now that everything is set up, let&rsquo;s just start right away.</p>

<p>We create a short script to make the Arduino&rsquo;s on board LED blinking
and to report this via the serial port. Note that we will do so in a
distinct folder. Since we have to use a separate Makefile for every
Arduino script, it&rsquo;s good practice to keep them all separated in
different folders.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir blinking
cd blinking
touch blinking.ino
touch Makefile
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>blinking.ino</em> script will contain the following lines of code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">// Number of the LED's pin
const int led = 13;

// Run once on initialization
void setup(){
  // Setup the serial communication
  Serial.begin( 9600 );
  // Use LED as output
  pinMode( led, OUTPUT );
}

// Run until resetting or switching of the power supply
void loop(){
  // Turn on the LED
  digitalWrite( led, HIGH );
  // Wait a second
  delay( 1000 );
  // Turn the LED off again
  digitalWrite( led, LOW );
  // Wait another second
  delay( 1000 );
  // Print a message via the serial port
  Serial.println( &quot;Hello world!&quot; );
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="create-a-makefile">Create a Makefile</h3>

<p>In order to compile the <em>blinking.ino</em> script, we still have to have a
<em>Makefile</em> containing all our configuration. Fortunately we already
dealt with the configuration in an earlier step. The only thing left
to do is to tell compiler where to find <em>arduino-mk</em> package and which
Arduino board we are using.</p>

<p>Therefore the minimal version of our <strong>Makefile</strong> consists of two
lines. (Make sure it resides in the same folder as the <em>blinking.ino</em>
script.)</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">BOARD_TAG = mega2560
include /usr/share/arduino/Arduino.mk
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>arduino-mk</em> package will now just reference to the a copy of the
<em>preferences.txt</em> file to obtain all additional configuration
necessary for compilation.</p>

<h3 id="compile-and-upload-the-code">Compile and upload the code</h3>

<p>The most important command to use in Arduino-mode is certainly the one
compiling the code and uploading the result to the Arduino. This is
done in one single step</p>

<p><strong>M-x compile RET make -k upload</strong></p>

<p>Immediately afterwards your Arduino should start blinking.</p>

<h3 id="connect-to-the-serial-port">Connect to the serial port</h3>

<p>Now that our script is running and the LED is blinking, we also want
to see what the Arduino tries telling us. For this, just open a new
instance of your
<a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror/multi-term">multi-term</a> in a separate
buffer and enter the following commands.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">stty /dev/ttyACM0 9600
stty /dev/ttyACM0 raw
cat &lt; /dev/ttyACM0
</code></pre>

<p>This terminal will keep listening to the serial port connected to the
Arduino and display everything it has to say. (Note, the digit behind
/dev/ttyACM can differ)</p>

<h2 id="using-the-nfc-shield">Using the NFC shield</h2>

<p>Next, I connected my <a href="http://www.elechouse.com/elechouse/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=90_93&amp;products_id=2242">Elechouse NFC Module
V3</a>
shield to my Arduino Mega</p>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2017/mensa-card-hack/wiring-arduino.jpeg" alt="wiring" /></p>

<p>and wrote a little script to detect a NFC tag.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">// Use the Serial-Peripheral Interfaces to communicate with the Arduino
#if 0
  #include &lt;SPI.h&gt;
  #include &lt;PN532_SPI.h&gt;
  #include &lt;PN532.h&gt;
  #include &lt;NfcAdapter.h&gt;

  PN532_SPI pn532spi( SPI, 10 );
  NfcAdapter nfc = NfcAdapter( pn532spi );
#elif 0 // If SPI is not working, set this one to 1 to use HSU
  #include &lt;PN532_HSU.h&gt;
  #include &lt;PN532.h&gt;
  #include &lt;NfcAdapter.h&gt;
      
  PN532_HSU pn532hsu( Serial1 );
  NfcAdapter nfc = NfcAdapter( pn532hsu );
#else // This one I used with my NFC shield
  #include &lt;PN532_I2C.h&gt;
  #include &lt;PN532.h&gt;
  #include &lt;NfcAdapter.h&gt;
  #include &lt;Wire.h&gt;

  PN532_I2C pn532i2c( Wire );
  NfcAdapter nfc = NfcAdapter( pn532i2c );
#endif

// Run once on initialization
void setup() {
  Serial.begin( 9600 );
  Serial.println(&quot;Starting up NDEF reader...&quot;);
  nfc.begin();
}

// Run until resetting or switching of the power supply
void loop(){
  if ( nfc.tagPresent() ){
    // A tag was detected
    NfcTag tag = nfc.read();
    Serial.println( &quot;Found a tag!&quot; );
    // Print the type of the tag
    Serial.println( tag.getTagType() );
    // And its Unifersal identifier (its name)
    Serial.print( &quot;UID: &quot; );
    Serial.println( tag.getUidString() );
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In order to establish a serial connection to the shield, I had to use
the I2C protocol and switch a tiny switch on the shield. In addition
you have to declare all libraries in the <em>Makefile</em> you are about to
use in your script!</p>

<p>For communicating via I2C, I had to add the following line.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">ARDUINO_LIBS = NDEF PN532 PN532_I2C Wire
</code></pre>

<h2 id="reading-the-mensacard-and-the-tag">Reading the Mensacard and the tag</h2>

<p>Now our big moment has finally come and we are ready to read the
content of the Mensacard!</p>

<p>But when I tried it: nothing&hellip; :| But the tag is working just fine. :|</p>

<p>Shit.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s not that trivial after all to access the content of NFC
cards. It&rsquo;s quite discontent, but I there are a whole bunch of other
things in my pipeline. So I won&rsquo;t buy different hardware to access the
card&rsquo;s information. But I will keep it. Who knows, maybe one day I
have a phone/shield capable of reading it.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>Okay, with this I will end my endeavor of accessing the content of the
Mensacard. I really enjoyed playing around with JavaScript and Apache
Cordova and I finally managed to use my Arduino again. It was quite a
lot of fun and I feel more comfortable carrying my Mensacard in my
wallet without any protection. I hope you enjoyed it too.</p>

<p>So be skeptical of new trends in technology
<a href="https://digitalcourage.de/themen/rfid">surveillance</a>, use
<a href="http://www.ebay.de/itm/5-NFC-Schutzhullen-NFC-Blocker-Schutz-der-Kreditkarte-EC-Karte-Personal-/121924193167?hash=item1c633f8b8f:g:ZSgAAOSwAuNW5o22">condoms</a>,
and never stop exploring new technologies.</p>
