But requiring the user to handle a statistical programming language, restricts the usage to domain experts. So, how to reach the general public and to make them aware of the changes of in the extreme weather events? For this purpose I wrote a [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)-based web app providing an intuitive and interactive way to apply all the functionality of the **climex** package to a large data set."

This post provides an introduction into the basic handling of the
**climexUI** web app and how its run on your local computer. You can
try it [here](climex.pks.mpg.de).

# Prerequisites

### Installation path

The **climex** web app needs several files to be powered and all of them
will be stored in a folder defined in the option `climex.path`, which
will point to *~/R/climex/* per default. If your are fine with this
choice, feel free to skip the remainder of this subsection.

A web app, like the **shiny**-based one provided by this package, needs
loads of different files: _.css_ files to shape and beautify its
appearance, _.js_ files enabling the app to perform logic and
calculations within your browser to provide further customization and
a more natural interaction, all the displayed images and gifs etc.

Fortunately, you don't have to care about all these files since the
wrapper function `climex()` will take them from the package's
installation path and copy them all in the `climex.path` folder the
app will be run in. The only thing you have to care about is *where*
all these things are copied to.

By default all resources will be stored in your home in a folder
called *~/R/climex/*. To change its path, add the following lines to
the R configuration file *~/.Rprofile* in your home.

```{r configuration, eval=FALSE}
## Replace PATH by the directory you want to store all files related
## to the climex app into.
options( climex.path = "PATH" )
```

### Input data

The web app provided in the **climexUI** package is meant to be a
convenient interface to perform the extreme value analysis
interactively on a large set of station data. But the main ingredient,
the data itself, has to be provided by the user herself. If you
haven't gathered lots of data yet, don't worry. You can use the
[dwd2r](https://gitlab.com/theGreatWhiteShark/dwd2r) package to
retrieve quite a number of climatological time series measured within
Germany (and provided by the German weather service (DWD)).

The app itself should be started using the auxiliary function
`climex()` and the data has to be provided using its
`list.data.sources` input argument in a very particular format. The
basic time series can have two different formats. They must be either
of class **xts** or **data.frame**s containing two columns called
_value_ and _date_ where the former is of class **numeric** and the
latter is of class **Date**. All these time series have to be elements
of a named **list** with the names corresponding to the ones of the
individual stations the data was measured at. From one or many of
those lists another named **list** will be constructed with its names
corresponding to the ones of the individual data sets (lists of time
series). This is, finally, the proper format of the
`list.data.sources` input argument. The elements of the top level
(data sets) and second level lists (stations) can be selected using
two drop-down menus in the sidebar of the application. Examples for
well formatted second level lists can be obtained by running the
`dwd.download()` function of the **dwd2r** package with the
`batch.choices = c( 1, 1, 5, 1)` argument. The original intent was to
group different climatological quantities in the top level of the list
and the corresponding stations into the second level. But you can use
the first level of hierarchy of `list.data.sources` as you like and
group the data in a way that fits you best. However, the second level
_must_ be named according to the corresponding stations and the name of
the list elements containing the time series will be used to extract the
position data from the second input argument `data.frame.positions`.

`data.frame.positions` is an object linking the names of the stations
used in `list.data.sources` with the corresponding geographical
positions and has to be, again, provided in a very particular
format. One can either use a **data.frame** or a
**SpatialPointsDataFrame** provided by the **sp** package. The former
one has to contain at least three columns named _longitude_,
_latitude_, and _name_ with the first two being of class **numeric**
and the last of class **character**. The spatial object, on the other
hand, has to contain the corresponding names of the station in a
column called _name_ of the **data.frame** in its _data_ slot. An
example for such an object can be found in the `station.positions`
object created when invoking the `dwd.download()` function of the
**dwd2r** package with the `batch.choices = c( 1, 1, 5, 1 )`
argument. Please note that the names are supposed to be unique and
that all time series in `list.data.sources` who's names are not
present in `data.frame.positions` won't be handled by the web app at
all.

### Starting the climex web application

It is strongly advised to start the web application provided in the
**climexUI** package using the `climex()` auxiliary function and the
input arguments described in the previous section. It will ensure the
data is properly formatted, it will resort to some fallback data if
this is not the case, and will copy all required scripts and files to
the folder the application is started in.

```{r wrapper, eval = FALSE}
library( climexUI )
climex()
```

Now, your R shell will open a server on your computer and the climex
app will be started in a new tab of your default web browser (Firefox
preferred. Don't feed the Google!). To **stop the app** just go to
your R shell and press Ctrl-c two times in a row.

Internally, the `climex()` function will run `runApp()` of the
**shiny** package in the prepared folder. The `climex.server()` and
`climex.ui()` functions are taking care of the actual work. The former
one will load the a file called _input.RData_ from the prerequisite
folder, which was written by the `climex()` function.

# Map tab

![map](/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2018/climexui/climex_map.jpeg)

This [leaflet](https://github.com/theGreatWhiteShark/leaflet)-based
tab is the default entry point of the climex app and its main purpose
is to provide a convenient way of navigation between the data of the
different stations.

While working with tens or hundreds of time series from different
geographical sites, it is always hard to keep their spatial relations,
like the distance between the stations, in mind. To overcome this
problem, a map-based selection interface was introduced in addition to
the *Station* selector in the sidebar.

Apart from being a selection interface for the station data the
**Map** tab features the following functions:

- Via the **Minimal length** slider only those time series containing
  more years than the chosen value will be shown on the map and will
  be accessible via the sidebar. This feature is extremely useful for
  finding long time series in the vastness of the provided data.
- When selecting a station via mouse click a summary statistic
  containing the station's name as well as its 20, 50, and 100 year
  return level will be displayed in the upper right corner of the map.
- In the control panel you can choose either the tiles of
  [OpenTopoMaps](https://opentopomap.org/) or
  [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to provide an
  underlying map. While the first one is more instructive in the
  context of climatic time series, I also faced some downtimes at some
  points in the past. Therefore, you always can use the default OSM map
  as a fallback solution.
- Using the **Return level** slider and the corresponding **Calculate
  return levels** button, the chosen return level will be calculated
  for all stations shown on the map.
- After the calculation finished (the cat in the wheel disappeared),
  an additional select item appears where you can choose to display
  the stations as blue markers (*stations*) and/or their return levels
  as colored cirlces (*returns*).  But beware: this can take up to
  several minutes depending an the number of stations displayed! Since
  all stations selected via the **Minimal length** slider will be
  considered in the calculation and not just the ones displayed after
  zooming in, only a limited amount of stations is supported when
  running the climex app within a Shiny server (e.g. at
  climex.pks.mpg.de). Locally, however, you can use as much stations
  as you like.

![heat-map](/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2018/climexui/climex_heat-map.jpeg)

All the changes to the preprocessing options in the **General** tab
will be considered while calculating the summary statistics and the
return levels of all displayed stations.
  
NOTE: The map is based on my fork of the **leaflet** package instead
of the original one since the developer seem to dislike my [pull
request](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/pull/342) for horizontal
and sizable legends. Without this the legend of the colored return
level markers would look just to weird and misplaced.

# The sidebar

As described in a previous section, the available data is structured
into two levels. The top level can be selected via the **Data set**
drop-down menu and the corresponding station of the second level via
the **Station** menu.

Right below all these drop-down menus there is a very important radio
button: the **Remove incomplete years** or **Declustering of the
data** button (depending on the choice of the extreme value
distribution in the **Options** box in the **General** tab). This
button will ensure your time series is getting cleaned and short-range
correlations as well as artifacts are getting removed before the
extreme value analysis does take place. So, only disable it if you
really know what you are doing!

But apart from the input data provided to the `climex()` function,
the web app is also able to draw and analyse random series distributed
according to the generalized extreme value (GEV) or generalize Pareto
(GP) distribution by selecting *Artificial data* in the **Data set**
drop-down menu. You can control the sampling process by adjusting the
**Location**, **Scale**, and **Shape** slider for the distribution's
parameters and the **Length** one for the number of points to be
sampled. Every time you update one of these sliders the time series is
getting redrawn. In addition, you can also use **Draw** button to
redraw it manually.

# General tab

![time-series](/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2018/climexui/climex_time-series.jpeg)

This tab provides both an interface to change the preprocessing
options used throughout the whole application as well as a variety of
tools to analyze an individual time series. Keep in mind: whenever you
change an option within this tab it will affect the analysis performed
in the entire app.

### *GEV fit* box

This box contains four different plots: 

- The overall fitting result consisting of a blueish histogram of the
  extreme events of the time series and the orange-colored GEV/GP
  probability density distribution constructed using the fitted
  parameters.
- Three goodness-of-fit plots highlighting the quality of the current
  fit. From top to bottom: a [p-p
  plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93P_plot), a [q-q
  plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%E2%80%93Q_plot), and a return
  level plot (see Stuart Coles, 2001, p. 58).

### *Options* box

Via the settings in this box all the preprocessing options are
controlled throughout the app.

#### Limiting distribution

This radio buttons control whether to fit the generalized extreme value
(*GEV*) distribution or the generalized Pareto (*GP*) one.

#### Box length in days | Threshold

Via this slider the extreme events will be obtained from your time
series. Depending on the choice of limiting distribution, it will
either determine the number of days of a time series constituting a
block in the GEV approach or the height of the threshold above which
all events will be considered extreme. The default value of one year
for the block method is recommended especially since the user can
change the deseasonalization method and may end up with seasonal
correlations in the data.

Remember: The approximation of the histogram using both the GEV and
the GP distribution is only valid for an asymptotic block length and
threshold height. So don't pick too low values!

#### Type of extreme

If set to *Min*, the GEV distribution will be fitted to the block
_minima_ and the GP distribution to all events _below_ the specified
threshold.

#### Deseasonalization method

Using this selector you can choose if and how to get rid of the
short-range correlations in your time series introduced by the annual
cycle. Per default the
[anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_(natural_sciences)#Atmospheric_sciences)
will be calculated. But you can also
pick other **R**-based implementations like
[stl](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/stl.html),
[decompose](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/decompose.html),
and the **ds** function from the
[deseasonalize](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deseasonalize)
package.

### *Results* box

This table displays several details of the GEV fitting procedure:

- The GEV/GP parameters *location*, *scale*, and *shape*
- The augmented negative log-likelihood (*nllh*) of the fit as well as
  the
  [Akaike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion)
  and [Bayesian Information
  criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion)
- The 100 year return level

For the distribution's parameter and the return level a small change
while varying the preprocessing options does suggest the stability of
the fitting procedure and thus a high quality of the time series. This
will be indicated by a green color whereas large changes are indicated
in red. For the nllh, AIC, and BIC the values should be as low as
possible. That's why all decreases are marked green and all increases
red.

To better review the influence of the individual parameter changes, not
just the current results and statistics but also the ones from the
three last fits (in the *hist_1*, *hist_2*, and *hist_3* column) are
contained in the table.

### *Time series* box

In the *Pure* tab you can view the raw and unprocessed time
series. The *Deseasonalized* tab uses the former series and applies
the function specified in the *Deseasonalization method* drop-down
menu of the **Options** box to it. Both plots contain the extracted
extreme events as additional orange points and are generated using the
[dygraphs](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dygraphs)
library. That's why you are also able to zoom into them using your
mouse!

The *Remaining* tab contains all the events in your time series, which
got extracted in the blocking or thresholding. Those can be considered
the extreme events of the series. Since it is often quite interesting
to see what will happen to your fitted parameters when discarding
individual events (like the most extreme ones), you can toggle all the
points by clicking them or brush them using your mouse. When
deactivated they do not contribute to the fitting anymore and the
optimization is being redone instantly.
