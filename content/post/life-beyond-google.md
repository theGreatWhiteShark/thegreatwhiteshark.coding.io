You love your Android phone but dislike Google collecting every single bit of information to sell it or to manipulate you with tailored information products? Good news, there is life beyond Google!

There are plenty of reasons to dislike Google's attempts to collect all your data and thus to strip you from even the slightest bit of privacy. I reached a turning point when I deleted a bunch of obsolete contacts and phone numbers about a year ago. Some minutes later a message popped up pointing out that I deleted too many contacts and all of a sudden they were present again. So I am not allowed to manage my own contact list? Fuck you Google! But I don't want this blog to be about politics. So enough of this. Only one remark: Google also uses their customers accounts to [blackmail](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/17/google-suspends-customer-accounts-for-reselling-pixel-phones) them. 

In this blog I will tell you how to use your Android phone without Google. But don't worry. You don't have to an Android developer to try this at home. In fact, there is no programming involved at all. First, I'll show you which free and open-source apps you can use to replace the proprietary ones. Second, we will use [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) or [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/) instead of Google to manage all of our contacts and appointments and finally I will point out some alternative versions of the Android operation system. 

Don't get me wrong. I don't advice you to level your smartphone and to start from scratch with a different OS, which might turn out pretty buggy. Follow those three parts only ?so far you feel comfortable with?. It's a good idea to try the apps in part one on your current device first. The final step of switching to an alternative Android version is best done when you are buying a new phone and need to customize it anyway.
