+++

The internal representation of spatial objects in R is quite
complicated. You might already experienced this while searching for
neat ways to plot maps of your data online. When everything you know
consists of data.frames, lists, strings, and factors, you most
probably had a hard time dealing with the answers presented there. But
this is about to change. Once introduced to their representation,
spatial objects and the corresponding plotting routines become as
simple and straight forward as any other R objects. 

# Geospatial libraries and formats

There is a whole zoo of different libraries and formats dealing with
spatial objects out there. So let's make a quick guided tour and
review the most important ones. 

The
[GEOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTS_Topology_Suite#GEOS_Library)
packages, a C++ port of the **JTS** (Java Topology Suite), provides
classes for basic geometric objects (like points, polygons, and lines)
and definitions for operations performed on them (e.g. point in
polygon or distance measures). In addition it is also able to
import and export [WKT (Well-known
text)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) files, their
binary presentation **WKB**, and [GML (Graphical Markup
Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language)
files. All these markup documents can represent both spatial objects
and their coordinate reference systems.

Fortunately you don't have to care about the various data formats for
spatial data at all. Imagine the following scenario: Someone is
providing you data in format A, which you have to transform into
format B since your analysis is incompatible with the former one, and
finally you have to hand your results to a collaborator in format
C. In most fields, especially in data science itself, all those
conversions are prone to cause a lot of trouble and force you to
manually adjust the import and export procedures. But for spatial data
you have the [GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction
Library)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL). This very powerful and
convenient package builds on top of **GEOS** and handles the reading
and writing of 120 different raster and vector data formats used in
geospatial applications. So whatever format you are dealing with, the
**GDAL** package handles the import and provides you the data using
the classes implemented in **GEOS**.

Our last main ingredient is the [CRS (Coordinate reference
system)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_reference_system)
describing the projection of a spatial object onto a map and its
transformation into other CRS. This is quite important because a
coordinate is basically nothing but a number. Without a
reference placing them on a map those numbers are meaningless. Well,
this might seems a little bit trivial since the usage of the equator,
the prime meridian, and sea level are so common. But think about
it. Due to the climate change the mean sea level is rising. So does
the altitude of things decrease? As it turns out not even the [prime
meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian_(Greenwich)) is
at a latitude of exactly zero on GPS receivers. Therefore we need
reference systems. Of course there are dozens. Some of them only span
the entire world, some just specific countries, and others are tailored to the need of
specific software and companies. We will stick to the most popular
[WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS84),
which covers the whole globe.

As a matter of consistency, operations involving objects using
different CRS are usually prohibited. Thus, we need the
[PROJ.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROJ.4) C-library to handle
both the transformation between the different systems and the actual
projection of the spatial information onto a map.

# Geospatial packages in R

The implementation in R looks quite similar. But here it is the **sp**
package providing the classes and definition of the underlying spatial
objects. Since most (if not all) R packages focusing on handling and
plotting spatial objects are relying on this one, you can very easily
interconnect various packages in your analysis making R an ideal language
to work with this kind of data. So even if you are a R user but don't
plan to work with spatial objects, checking out
[this](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2005-2.pdf#section*.12)
short introduction into the different classes and methods for spatial
data is still a good idea.

Next we have the **rgdal** and the **rgeos** package. As you might
already guess, they are both wrappers around the corresponding
libraries. But remember, it's still the **sp** packages providing the
definitions of the spatial objects. So whenever you import some
spatial data using the **rgdal** package it reads it with the
standardized **GEOS** API and directly converts these objects into the
classes implemented by the **sp** package.

For displaying our results we basically have three different options:
the **ggmap**, **tmap**, and **leaflet** package. I will cover all
them this blog post.

Worth mentioning are also the two package **maps** and **maptools** for
providing different tools to manipulate spatial objects and the
[sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) package. The latter is supposed
to provide a more simple implementation of spatial objects and cover
the functionality of the **sp**, **rgdal**, and **rgeos** package. But
it is still under active development.

### Installation

In order to install all those aforementioned R packages, you have to
have some additional libraries installed on your system first.
```{bash}
# In Debian-based distributions.
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libjq-dev libv8-3.14-dev libprotobuf-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev libudunits2-dev

```

Depending on which distribution is running on your computer, you might
have to download and install a more recent
[GDAL](http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/) version in order to install
the **tmap** package. If you were successful in installing it
using `install.packages( "tmap" )`, skip the following code
chunk.

```{bash}
# In case your system's repositories provide a GDAL package too 
# old for the R packages above, you have to install a newer one 
# from source.
# Download (into a folder you neither move, rename, or delete!)
wget http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/2.2.2/gdal-2.2.2.tar.gz
# Extract the folder
tar -xf gdal-2.2.2.tar.gz
cd gdal-2.2.2
# Run the ./configure script to tell the package all your local 
# libraries, programs, and configurations
./configure
# Compile the source code
make
# Install the compiled code
sudo make install
```

Now we can load all the required packages into our R environment.

```{r}
library( stringr )
library( dplyr )
library( tidyr )
library( rgdal )
library( maptools )
library( ggmap )
library( tmap )
library( OpenStreetMap ) # For more apealing visualization
library( leaflet )
```

# Import and preparation of our data
### Import

Firstly, we will download the polygons of the election districts.

```{r}
## Download the files into a separated folder created in the current one.
download.folder <- "bundeswahlleiter/"
if ( !dir.exists( download.folder ) ){
  dir.create( download.folder )
}

## This URL contains all the geographical information.
election.districts.url <- "https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/dam/jcr/f92e42fa-44f1-47e5-b775-924926b34268/btw17_geometrie_wahlkreise_geo_shp.zip"
## For convenience reason let's split the URL at all '/'. This way
## we can directly access the file name.
## Download
election.districts.url.split <- str_split(
    election.districts.url, "/" )[[ 1 ]]
download.file( url = election.districts.url,
              destfile = paste0( download.folder,
                                election.districts.url.split[ 7 ] ),
              method = "wget" )
## Extract the data for the election districts
unzip( paste0( download.folder, election.districts.url.split[ 7 ] ),
      exdir = download.folder )
```

The data format our polygons are provided in is the so called
[Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile). It is a vector
format incorporating associated attribute information and features a
number of actual files (the mandatory ones are marked with 'm').

 - .shp (m): Main shape file providing the coordinates for the
   different geometries 
 - .shx (m): Provides indices for the geometries
 - .dbf (m): Holds the attribute information for the each spatial
   objects in separated columns
 - .cpg: Specifies the code page/character set used for the encoding
   of the attributes
 - .prj: Provides the CRS and the projection information in WKT
 - .sbn/.sbx: Binary spatial indices of the features.
 - .shp.xml: Contains geospatial metadata
 
You see, the term 'Shapefile' is quite counterintuitive since it
consists of several files at ones.

Now we import the Shapefile into the R environment using the **rgdal**
package.

```{r}

## Import all the spatial information into one single data object.

## https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/wiki/plotting-polygon-shapefiles
election.districts <- readOGR( dsn = paste0( download.folder, "." ),
                              layer = "Geometrie_Wahlkreise_19DBT_geo" )
```

### Handling spatial objects in R

The *election.districts* object is not an ordinary R object like a
list or data.frame, as already noted, but of a special spatial class
provided by the **sp** package. It sure builds on top of those
fundamental classes, but it's defined using the more strict S4 object
class. Thus, we aren't able to use the `name()` function to access the
names of all its components and can't access those using the `$`
symbol either. Instead of list elements, S4 based objects consist of
different *slots* accessible using `@` symbol. You can get the
names of all available slots using the `slotNames()` function.

For our *election.districts* objects we care most about the *polygons*
slot containing a list of all the different polygons consisting of the
longitude and latitude coordinates of all their vertices and some
metadata as well as the *data* slot holding a data.frame with the
numbers and names of the individual election districts and the numbers
and names of the corresponding states. The latter is also called an
'attribute table'. 

```{r}
slotNames( election.districts )
```

> [1] "data"        "polygons"    "plotOrder"   "bbox"        "proj4string"

```{r}
## Slot names of the first polygon stored in election.districts
slotNames( election.districts@polygons[[ 1 ]] )
```

> [1] "Polygons"  "plotOrder" "labpt"     "ID"        "area"

```{r}
## ID of the first polygon
election.districts@polygons[[ 1 ]]@ID
```

> [1] "0"

```{r}
## First rows of the data slot
head( election.districts@data )
```

>      WKR_NR LAND_NR LAND_NAME                          WKR_NAME

>      1      01      Schleswig-Holstein             Flensburg â€“ Schleswig

>      2      01      Schleswig-Holstein Nordfriesland â€“ Dithmarschen Nord

>      3      01      Schleswig-Holstein      Steinburg â€“ Dithmarschen SÃ¼d

>      4      01      Schleswig-Holstein             Rendsburg-EckernfÃ¶rde

>      5      01      Schleswig-Holstein                              Kiel

>      6      01      Schleswig-Holstein                 PlÃ¶n â€“ NeumÃ¼nster

As you can see, the ID of each polygon/election district matches the
name of the row (leftmost digit) of the data.frame stored in the *data*
slot. In order relate it using the number of the election districts
later on, we will have to increment (add 1) the IDs once. For a more
thorough introduction to the S4 object class see the object-oriented
chapter of Hadley's [advanced
R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#s4) book.

### Importing the cleaned results of the election

Now we will import the results of the election we cleaned during the
[previous blog post](bundestagswahl-pt-i)
into our current R environment. Note: we will use the last version of
the *data.separated* object renamed to *election.results*. It's a
little bit inconsistent, but I decided to give it a more descriptive
name to make things more clear within this and all following posts.

```{r}

download.file( url = "https://github.com/theGreatWhiteShark/blog-resources/blob/master/coding/bundestag-election/election.results.RData?raw=true",
              destfile = paste0( download.folder,
                                "election.results.RData" ) )

## Load the cleaned results of the election
## Include a link to Github!
load( paste0( download.folder, "election.results.RData" ) )
```

### Selecting the results we want to display

In this example we will work again with the preliminary total number
of second votes for the leftists and another party called "Die
Partei".

```{r}
## Exclude the states (since they cause the
## election.district.number to be not unique )
election.results.no.states <- filter( election.results,
                                       state.number != 99 )

## The amount of 2nd votes for the leftists (die Linke)
counts.leftists.second.vote <-
  filter( election.results.no.states,
         confirmation.status == "VorlÃ¤ufig" &
         type.of.vote == "Zweitstimmen" &
         party == "DIE LINKE" )

## The amount of 2nd votes for die Partei
counts.partei.second.vote <-
  filter( election.results.no.states,
         confirmation.status == "VorlÃ¤ufig" &
         type.of.vote == "Zweitstimmen" &
         party == "Partei fÃ¼r Arbeit, Rechtsstaat, Tierschutz, ElitenfÃ¶rderung und basisdemokratische Initiative" )

```

# Plotting

Generally speaking it is possible to use the base `plot()` function
for plotting your polygons and to add additional layers representing
the information you want to display.

```{r}
plot( election.districts )
```

![raw plot](/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2017/bundestagswahl2/plot-raw.jpeg)

But I would highly recommend using more advanced packages instead. 

In this tutorial I will cover the three main packages concerned with
plotting maps: the **ggmap**, the **tmap**, and the **leaflet**
package. So which one of these serves your needs best?

The [ggmap](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) package builds on top of
[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/), which features a
very intuitive way of handling your data and enables you to display
loads of information using as few lines of codes as possible. Since
**ggplot2** should definitely be your package of choice for generating
plots in R, it's most convenient to add a layer of tiles to your
existing plot using the **ggmap** package. But at the moment of
writing the package is just badly implemented and a lot of things do
not work. The broken OpenStreetMap support also seems to be a
[feature](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap/issues/172) and not a
bug. Nope. If all you want is to draw polygons, points, and lines,
it's a good idea to stick with the **ggplot2** package. If you,
instead, want to add tiles (parts of an actual map, like
e.g. OpenStreetMap etc.), I would recommend the use of the **tmap**
package.

[tmap](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap) is based on the same Grammar
of Graphics as **ggplot2**, is also structured using layers and
aesthetics, and tries to provide the same syntax as the latter
one. You'll have many different themes of maps and ways to modify your
results and the package itself is quite intuitive.

The [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package, on the
other hand, takes things a few steps further. Using the
[htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) package it provides an
interactive, JavaScript-based browser application. If you just want to
produce some nice plots, this one is clearly over the top. You
actually have less flexibility to manipulate the appearance of the map
since you are relying on a R wrapper around the JavaScript package
[leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). But if you have high dimensional
data to explore, this package can significantly ease the pain of
extracting knowledge from your data set.


###  Plotting using ggmap

Since the **ggplot2** package and its handling goes beyond the scope
of this post, I would recommend you to either have a look at
[Hadley's](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) short but
comprehensive introduction or to read over the code without a
thorough understanding of what's going on.

As a brief summary: The code for the **ggplot2** package is structured
in layers. We will print the tiles, the polygons etc. layer after
layer on top of each other. All arguments for the functions producing
e.g. lines or points can take two different types of input. Either one
single constant number or string or a whole vector. The latter can
hold numerical or character values and is called an *aesthetic*. Using
those we can e.g. make the alpha value of each polygon to alter
according to the number of votes or pick the color of the election
district according to the party, which received the majority of votes.

The first thing we have to do when dealing with the **ggmap** or
**ggplot2** package is to convert our data into a data.frame. Spatial
data formats are not supported.

```{r}
## Converting the spatial object into a data.frame better suited
## for the 'ggplot2' package.
election.districts.df <- fortify( election.districts )
```

The resulting data.frame contains a separate row for each of the
vertices containing the columns longitude, latitude, id, and group
among others. The *group* column is used to associate all points to a
distinct polygon and the *id* specifies the name of the
corresponding row in the *election.districts* attribute table. To
obtain the numbers of the election districts, which we need to relate
the points to the election results, we have to increment the *id*
column ones.

```{r}
## Convert the IDs of the polygons to the same key used to
## identify the election districts.
election.districts.df$election.district.number <-
  as.numeric( election.districts.df$id ) + 1
```
Now we can relate the election results to the points constituting the
election districts.
```{r}
## Add the counts to all points of the corresponding polygons
election.districts.df <- left_join( election.districts.df,
                                   counts.leftists.second.vote,
                                   by ="election.district.number")
```
For the final plot we first get map tiles we will use as a basis for
our map with the `get_map()` function. But be careful: this one is
quite buggy! The true boundaries of the supplied polygons do not
work. So instead we have to adjust them carefully by hand.

Afterwards we'll plot the districts on top of the tiles.
```{r}
## Download map tiles. Be careful: this interface is quite buggy!
## The true boundaries of the supplied polygons do not work. Instead
## One has adjust the boundaries careful by hand.
map.tiles <- get_map( location = #bbox( election.districts ) )
                        c( left = 0, bottom = 47,
                          right = 20, top = 56 ) )
## Plotting the polygons on top of the map tiles.
ggmap( map.tiles ) + geom_polygon( data = election.districts.df,
                        aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group,
                            alpha = counts ),
                        color = 'black', fill = '#df0404' ) +
coord_quickmap() + theme_minimal() + xlab( "" ) + ylab( "" ) +
  scale_alpha_continuous( guide = FALSE )
## 'coord_quickmap()' ensures the axis to be of the right ratio
## to prevent a stretching of the displayed map.
```

![plot ggmap](/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2017/bundestagswahl2/ggmap-leftists.jpeg)

### Plotting using tmap
In contrast to the **ggplot2** package **tmap** sole purpose is to
neatly visualize maps. Its most natural class to work with is not the
data.frame, but spatial objects provided by the **sp**
package. Therefore in this approach we will relate the extracted
number of votes to the attribute information of the spatial object
*election.districts* itself.

Firstly, we have to rename the *election.district.number* of the
data.frame holding the results to match the *WKR_NR* column in the
*data* slot of our shape object. In addition also we have to change
the format of our data. Since every row in the attribute table is
related to a specific polygon, we have to add the election results for
different parties in separate columns (instead of one with an addition
column specifying the name of the party).

```{r}
## Renaming the column
counts.leftists.districts <- mutate( counts.leftists.second.vote,
                                    WKR_NR = election.district.number,
                                    counts.leftists = counts )
counts.partei.districts <- mutate( counts.partei.second.vote,
                                    WKR_NR = election.district.number,
                                    counts.partei = counts )
## Extracting only the relevant information
counts.leftists.districts <- select( counts.leftists.districts,
                                    WKR_NR, counts.leftists )
counts.partei.districts <- select( counts.partei.districts,
                                  WKR_NR, counts.partei )
## Combining the results by adding them into different columns.
counts.districts <- left_join( counts.leftists.districts,
                              counts.partei.districts,
                              by = "WKR_NR" )
counts.districts <- select( counts.districts, WKR_NR,
                           counts.leftists, counts.partei )
## Join the information about each polygon with the number of votes
## by the unique number of the election district.
election.districts@data <- left_join( election.districts@data,
                              counts.districts,
                              by = "WKR_NR" )
```
This may sounds quite frustrating and the resulting object is not
'clean' in the way we considered it throughout the last post. But
different packages prefer different data structures and formats and in
addition the libraries for 'tidying' data were established during the
last years and some packages haven't adapted (yet). But this is just
how it is in open source languages.

Now let's do a quick plot of the results. To do this with the least lines
of codes possible, the **tmap** package features the function `qtm()`,
which behaves similar as the `qplot()` function in **ggplot2**. But
this is not the only commonality. The **tmap** package as a whole is
very similar to **ggplot2**.
```{r}
## Using the number of votes to fill the polygons with color
qtm( election.districts, fill = c( "counts.leftists", "counts.partei" ),
    fill.palette = list( "Reds", "Blues" ), cols = 2 )
```

![quick tmap plot](/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2017/bundestagswahl2/quick-tmap.jpeg)

Next we will introduce map tiles provided by the OpenStreetMap project
and plot the polygons of the election districts on top of them.

```{r}
## Using the more verbose version of the writing code of the tmap package
tm_shape( tmaptools::read_osm( bbox( election.districts ) ) ) +
  tm_raster() + tm_shape( election.districts ) +
  tm_polygons( "counts.leftists", palette = "Reds", alpha = .5,
              fill.title = "Number of second votes for the leftists" )
```

![tmap osm](/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2017/bundestagswahl2/tmap-osm-leftists.jpeg)

The **tmap** package features two different [drawing
modes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-modes.html). Beforehand
we were using the *plot* mode generating highly customizable maps in
X11 device windows. Alternatively, we can use **tmap** as a wrapper around the
JavaScript package leaflet via the *view* mode.
```{r}
## Displayed in the browser using leaflet package
tm_shape( tmaptools::read_osm( bbox( election.districts ) ) ) +
  tm_raster() + tm_shape( election.districts ) +
  tm_polygons( "counts.leftists", palette = "Reds", alpha = .5,
              fill.title = "Number of second votes for the leftists" ) +
  tmap_mode( "view" )
```

![tmap shiny](/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2017/bundestagswahl2/screenshot-leftists-tmap.jpeg)

Now let's plot something more advanced. For example the top 20
election districts ranked according to the number of votes for the
leftists. To get a better feeling of the actual size of the
individual districts we will use OpenStreetMap tiles for the
background.

There are two main things to learn in this little example. Firstly,
functions for manipulating and cleaning data do not work on the
spatial object itself, but just on its attribute table. This might
seems kinda odd in the beginning since `names( election.districts )`
and `head( election.districts$counts.partei` act like they would
deal with the attribute table instead of the raw
polygons. In fact `election.districts$counts.leftists` is just a
shortcut for `election.districts@data$counts.leftists`. But such
shortcuts only exist for a small number of functions and in order to
assure compatibility of your code with future releases of packages,
it's best practice to make all data assessments as explicit as
possible.

Secondly, there is the concept of *factors* in R. Factors are character
vectors, which are only allowed to hold a predefined number of
possible elements called *levels*. Okay. So why would someone need a
second type of characters? Well, in the beginning of the R language,
almost 25 years ago, this trick gave a huge burst in CPU and memory
efficiency. As for today I would consider it to be a legacy
component. But legacy or not, it's still a commonplace. For a thorough
introduction into factors see the corresponding section in Hadley's [R
for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) book.

If we would just extract the rows of the spatial object holding the 20
largest values in the *counts.leftists* column and plot each of the
districts in their own subfigure separated by their unique name, the
order of the plots would be alphabetic. But this is not what we
intended. We want the order to be descending starting with the
district holding the largest number of votes. When we check out the
levels of the names of the election districts `levels(
election.districts@data$WKR_NAME )` we see that they are indeed
ordered alphabetically. So we have to (you might already guessed it)
change the order of the levels to represent the top 20 election
districts.

```{r}
## Displaying the election districts, which received the most votes.
## Extract the ordered names of the top 20 districts for the leftists.
top.20.districts <- as.character(
    arrange( election.districts@data,
            desc( counts.leftists ) )$WKR_NAME[ 1 : 20 ] )
## Selecting the spatial information for those 20 districts
election.districts.top.20 <- election.districts[
    election.districts@data$WKR_NAME %in% top.20.districts, ]

## Reordering the factor levels of the election districts according to
## the number of votes
election.districts.top.20@data$WKR_NAME <-
  factor( election.districts.top.20@data$WKR_NAME, levels = top.20.districts ) 

## Reordering of the factors according to the number of votes
tm_shape( tmaptools::read_osm( bbox( election.districts ),
                              type = "maptoolkit-topo") ) +
  tm_raster() + tm_shape( election.districts.top.20 ) +
  tm_polygons( "counts.leftists", legend.show = FALSE,
              alpha = .5, palette = "Reds" ) +
  tm_facets( "WKR_NAME", free.coords = TRUE ) + tmap_mode( "plot" )
```

In our final example for the **tmap** package we will check out one of
the many styles it is provides. We will plot both the number of
votes for the leftist and die Partei in a classical map format you
might remember from your textbooks in school. Since we do the plotting
for two different columns/data sets, it's best practice to avoid writing
two very similar chunks of code, but to instead to write a function
handling the job.

```r
## Function for generating a classical plot.
classic.map <- function( column.name, color.palette, title ){
  ## In order to feature 'counts' as the heading of the legend, we have
  ## to generate/rename the corresponding column.
  election.districts@data$counts <- election.districts@data[,column.name]
  tm_shape( election.districts ) +
    tm_polygons( "counts", palette = color.palette ) +
    tm_compass( position = c( "right", "bottom" ),
               color.light = "grey90" ) +
    tm_style_classic( inner.margins = c( .04, .03, .02, .01 ),
                     legend.position = c( "left", "bottom" ), 
                     legend.frame = TRUE, bg.color = "#f2d5b8",
                     legend.bg.color= "#f2d5b8", legend.bg.alpha = .3,
                     legend.text.size = .55, title = title,
                     legend.width = -.16,
                     earth.boundary = TRUE, space.color = "grey90",
                     sepia.intensity = .4, fontfamily = "Courier" )
}
## Generate the two plots (without actually plotting them)
map.leftists <- classic.map( "counts.leftists", "YlOrRd", "Leftists" )
map.partei <- classic.map( "counts.partei", "YlGnBu", "Die Partei" )
## Plot both figures next to eachother.
tmap_arrange( map.leftists, map.partei )

```

### Plotting using leaflet

The [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package produces
results quite similar to the ones generated in the *view* mode of
**tmap**. But since the main purpose of **leaflet** is to be an easy
to use wrapper around the JavaScript library
[leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) it will be much more simple and
convenient to tailor the resulting map to our needs.

All of the generated plots will be displayed in your default browser
inside a new tab. So let's make the most out of it and design our map
to be as informative as possible. Therefore we will write a list of
HTML codes called *labels* holding both the election districts names
and the 
total number of votes. Whenever you hover your mouse over one of the
polygons this label will be displayed. But of course not for the plot
you can see below, which is just a screenshot (since I'm writing this
as a static web page). So try it yourself!

```{r}
## Defining a custom palette for the map.
color.palette <- colorBin( "YlOrRd",
                          domain = election.districts@data$counts.leftists )
labels <- lapply( sprintf(
    "<strong>%s</strong><br/>number of votes: %g",
    election.districts$WKR_NAME, election.districts$counts.leftists ),
    htmltools::HTML )

leaflet( election.districts ) %>%
  addProviderTiles( "OpenStreetMap" ) %>%
  addPolygons( data = election.districts,
              fillColor = ~color.palette( counts.leftists ),
              opacity = 1, color = "black", fillOpacity = .5,
              weight = 1,
              highlight = highlightOptions(
                  weight = 3, color = "#555", fillOpacity = .8,
                  bringToFront = TRUE ),
              label = labels,
              labelOption = labelOptions(
                  style = list( "font-weight" = "normal",
                               padding = "3px 8px" ),
                  textsize = "15px",
                  direction = "auto" ) )
              

```

To get the most out of the leaflet package I strongly recommend to use
it in corporation with [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). There
you can have e.g. a widget with which you can select the parties,
which results you want to display on the map. It's a very powerful
package and out of the scope of the post. Check out the app of my
[climex](http://climex.pks.mpg.de) packages as a 
comprehensive example. So yes, you can host such little applications
too using [shiny-server](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server).
