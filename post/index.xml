      <description>I moved my blog from Wordpress to Github Pages.
In addition, I also decided to split the blog in three different parts. Art, coding, and music are just a little too diverse and I intend to do further posts in all of these subjects.
You can find the blogs via the following links

      <description>The paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge in 2015 was a game changer. It was not just one of the major sparks to light up the interest in deep learning in general, it also was one of the reasons Stephan and I started a reading group on machine learning back in the beginning of 2016. And we are still committed to it and meet at an almost weekly basis at time of writing (24.</description>

      <description>Computational skills are something almost every scientist has to offer nowadays. But unfortunately the least of us are actually trained in it. So most colleges (including me) took the autodidactic approach, a long road full of detours and wasted effort.
For those of you who are already decent programmers but did not dived into a lot of languages and tools, I try to compile a summary of all the essential stuff I tried during my PhD in this post.</description>

      <description>It is about my endeavors to create some neat plots of the results obtained using the proprietary DFT program VASP one and a half years ago. Since these files are usually pretty big it is important for your plotting script to rely on compiled C, C++ or Fortran code under the hood of a high level language like R or python. And you definitely want to have one of the latter ones for creating you plots since it is way more easy and beautiful.</description>
