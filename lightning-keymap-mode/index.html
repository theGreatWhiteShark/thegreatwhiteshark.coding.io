<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2018/lightning-keymap-mode/cheatsheet.png" alt="cheatsheet" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, the navigation in plain Emacs is not that
sophisticated. Actually, it&rsquo;s almost unusable. The approach of
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">Evil-mode</a>, on the other hand,
is not a bad idea but I never really liked the way VI is
doing things. Context switches are just not my style. I definitely
prefer the key combination approach of Emacs.</p>

<p>So what can be done instead? Well, why not creating a mixture of both
worlds?</p>

<p>This project started as a bunch of keybindings in a custom keymap in
my <em>.emacs</em> configuration file some years ago. Over time this keymap was
growing more and more in size and functionality and soon it became the
major part of my <em>.emacs</em>. At some point is said to myself: Okay, why
not just make a mode out of it? Maybe someone else could benefit
from this piece of software too. And it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to write
packages for programming languages. How hard could it be? Boy, it
can be hard ðŸ˜„ .</p>

<p>After struggling a while to make the keymap of my minor mode not just
working with the ones of all the other ones but also to lay on top of
them, I decided to place it in a variable called
<strong>overriding-local-map</strong>. This way it shadows all possible other
keybindings and you can always navigate using the <em>j k l ;</em> keys. But
on the other hand, keybindings assigned to specific words or regions
of the buffer, e.g. jumping to the next mark while expanding a snippet
using YASnippet, won&rsquo;t work anymore. But this is a price I am happy to
pay for a way faster and more convenient navigation. You disagree? Then
leave a comment or a mail. I&rsquo;m willing to adjust the package
for others to benefit from it too.</p>

<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.coding.io/images/posts/2018/lightning-keymap-mode/general-layout.png" alt="cheatsheet" /></p>

<p>In the <strong>lightning-keymap-mode</strong> a keymap tailored for fast navigation
and editing is superimposed on top of your regular keymaps using a
<em>minor mode</em>. Since this might shadow some essential key bindings you
use on a regular basis, you can turn the mode on and off using <strong>F5</strong>.</p>

<p>There are two basic ideas to this package:</p>

<ol>
<li>Navigation happens using the <strong>j</strong>, <strong>k</strong>, <strong>l</strong>, and <strong>; keys</strong>
and there are a bunch of useful and frequently used commands placed
on the surrounding keys, like killing (cutting), yanking (pasting),
copying, line breaks etc.</li>
<li>There are several different <strong>&lsquo;layers&rsquo;</strong> invoked by the <strong>Ctrl</strong>,
<strong>Meta</strong>, and <strong>Shift</strong> keys and their combinations.
While the <em>Ctrl</em> key is invoking basic (slow) navigation, like
moving forward or backward one line or character, the <em>Meta</em> key
speeds things up by moving forward or backward a word or
paragraph. The combination of both features the most fast
behaviour (e.g. <em>Ctrl + Meta + ;</em> will move the point to the end of
a line and <em>Ctrl + Meta + l</em> to the beginning of the buffer).
A notable exception is <em>Meta + Shift</em>, which is used to navigate
between buffers.
<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>The second idea is also applied on most of the additional key
bindings: <em>Ctrl + ,</em> deletes backwards a character, <em>Meta + ,</em> deletes
backwards a word, and <em>Ctrl + Meta + ,</em> deletes the current line
(apart from this, those commands are also sensitive towards marked
regions).</p>

<p>The evaluation of code chunks bound to the <strong>n</strong> key are currently just
supported for <strong>ESS</strong> and <strong>python-mode</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p>Make sure you have an <strong>Emacs 25.1 or newer</strong>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#gnu-linux">installed</a>.</p>

<p>In order to use the lightning-keymap-mode, you have to clone this
repository to your local device</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone git@github.com:theGreatWhiteShark/lightning-keymap-mode.git</code></pre></div>
<p>and add the following lines to your <em>.emacs</em> file in your home
folder.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl">(add-to-list <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;load-path</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;~/PATH-YOU-CLONED-LIGHTNING-KEYMAP-MODE-TO&#34;</span>)
(require <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;lightning-keymap-mode</span>)
(lightning-keymap-mode <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="customization">Customization</h1>

<p>By setting the <strong>lightning-basic-keymap</strong> variable to non-nil, the
user can decide whether she wants to use just the basic navigation and
line breaking instead of the full keybindings offered by the
lightning-keymap-mode.</p>

<p>If the variable <strong>lightning-keymap-mode-modifies-string-replacement</strong>
is set to non-nil, not the internal <code>string-replace</code> function, but a
customized version <code>lightning-keymap-mode-replace-string</code> will be
used. Within this function the default option of the <em>FROM</em> argument
of the replacement function (what to replace) will be set according to
word at point (at the current position). Therefore, it loses the
ability to perform the last replacement as the default. You are free
to decide on your own which functionality you find more useful.</p>

<p>For additional information and customization please refer to the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Easy-Customization">customization</a>
group <em>Editing &gt; Lightning</em> or the comment section in the beginning of
<a href="https://github.com/theGreatWhiteShark/lightning-keymap-mode/blob/master/lightning-keymap-mode.el">lightning-keymap-mode.el</a>.</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>If you plan to use <strong>YASnippet</strong> in combination with
<strong>lightning-keymap-mode</strong>, be sure to use a YASnippet version &gt;=
0.12.0!</p>
