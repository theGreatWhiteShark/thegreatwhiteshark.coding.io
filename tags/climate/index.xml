      <description>In the last post about the dwd2r R package I showed you how to retrieve large amount of observational data from within Germany. This is one of the highest quality data sets available and certainly a very nice starting point for your climatological analysis. But it only covers Germany. If you intend to analysis data from another location on the globe, hopefully the government of the corresponding country shares their data with you.</description>

      <description>The German weather service (DWD) provides a large set of climatological data under the following terms of use. This is an awesome starting point for data-driven software or research. But, as usual, it is only the starting point. The observational data itself is provided for all individual stations in separate files and split into the most recent and a historical part. This is of course quite convenient in case you want to update your data sets but it&amp;rsquo;s up to the user to combine both parts for each and every station.</description>
