      <description>Since at least the revelations of Edward Snowden we know that encryption is not just an important but also a quite pressing issue. But, unfortunately, there is no one size fits all algorithm that works with all kinds of data and communication protocols. We are therefore bound to at least peek into different topics of this rather complex field. But don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid. I wrote this introduction with people at a beginner level in Linux in mind and won&amp;rsquo;t touch a single bit of mathematical theory on encryption in here.</description>
